Plan for the financial statement handler and
associated financial files
============================================

+ add a sample of all incoming file names to the top data
  block in the program
+ read CSV transactions and eliminate dups
  extract transactions into months
+ get renaming cleaner
+ keep original, downloaded products in their own
  directory; create a script or function to copy or
  update into the mandatory local "./private" subdirectory;
+ investigate adding (and testing) an index number in
  the HWB CSV transactions to disambiguate seemingly
  identical transactions. assuming the original files
  have transactions in temporal order, such an index
  should start anew on the first of every month.
+ break HWB tranasction files into monthly ones
+ prove HWB tranaction files are additive, that is,
  a file downloaded this week contains the tranactions
  for last week
+ check to see if there is any significance in CSV
  file names from day to day
+ NOTE HWB CSV temporal order is reversed, .i.e.,
  the earliest transaction is on the end and the 
  latest is on the head (after the header line).
  And so are Synovus' files.
+ Add a role to help enable handlers for files
  from different banks
+ Add a routine to separate tranactions into months.
+ Improve docs.

Lower priority (OFX, PDF, API)
------------------------------

+ add an OFX handler
+ add ofx format and schema data
+ investigate XML::Class for OFX
+ investigate flycatcher's pdf2cvs conversion
+ use YNAB API for bank account access

===============
COMPLETED ITEMS
===============

+ require an env var for location of data # or, if not found, use "./private"
+ change c*u to a more appropriate name
